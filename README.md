# Final Capstone Project

The Final Capstone Project is the last project of my
Software Engineering boot camp. It is a program that
schedules assignment due dates with the abillity to
assign each assignment to a specific student. Through
hours of trying to make the program as efficient as
possible i believe the user should have an easy and
simple experience navigating the program with ease.

Files will be created on launch if they do not already
exist.
